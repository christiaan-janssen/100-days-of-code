# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the first three chapters of *Test-Driven development with Python*. 

**Thoughts:** Spend a lot of time getting selenium up and running, as well as my python emacs config. Having problems focusing on programming and not other stuff.
